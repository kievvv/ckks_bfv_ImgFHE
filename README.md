本项目基于[TenSEAL](https://github.com/OpenMined/TenSEAL)库实现，是《数据安全与隐私保护》课程Project，内容是比较不同全同态加密算法的效率。
由于是课程作业性质，这里的重点放在了运行效率的比较，没有将server端和client段做严谨区分，context的公私钥分离也略显潦草，仅供参考。
图片数据已包含在`./data`里，直接运行py文件即可。

This project is implemented based on the [TenSEAL](https://github.com/OpenMined/TenSEAL) library and serves as a project for the "Data Security and Privacy Protection" course. The content involves the efficiency comparison of different fully homomorphic encryption algorithms. 
Due to the nature of the coursework, the emphasis here is on the comparison of running efficiency. The distinction between the server and client sides is not rigorously addressed, and the separation of public and private keys in the context is somewhat crude.
Image data is already included in the `./data` directory; simply run the Python file.
